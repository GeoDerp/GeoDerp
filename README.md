#### About me 
-----
A tech head who loves solving tech related problems via reverse engineering or learning how tools work. I enjoy automation and creating scripts/tools to make repetitive tasks less aggravating. I use Fedora Linux as my daily driver on a daily basis, and prefer creating, and using, open source software where possible.
